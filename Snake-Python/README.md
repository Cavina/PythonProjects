# snakeGame.py 
I thought it would be cute to rebuild Snake in Python.  I hadn't used Pygame to complete a project, and I ended up following a quick tutorial.
At this point, the tutorial has eluded my browser history as I originally completed this project in 2017.  I left my original code from working through the project here, so that
it can be compared to my OOP approach.

As I worked my way speedily through the tutorial, I was not completely enthused with the instructor's coding.  I made a few minor changes here and there.  Most notably, 
I changed the code to an OOP approach.  My knowledge of OOP at that time was a little less practiced than it is now, and I had only used it in Java and C++.  I also added
music to the game.

It has been a few years since I actively used Python with my focus being on math and C++ currently.
I have completed quite a few mini-projects in the past and will be adding them as I go through them again.
Some of them, like my visual representation of the N-queens problem, I actually broke somehow in the past before I 
used Source control.  I should definitely go back and get it though.
